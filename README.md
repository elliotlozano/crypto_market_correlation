# Cryptocurrency Price Action versus Stock Market and Volatility Index
`Project 1 for Rice University's FinTech Boot Camp`

---

## Introduction:

### Project Description:

The purpose of this project is to determine correlations between the market as exemplified by the S&P 500 using SSgA Active Trust - S&P 500 ETF TRUST ETF (SPY), the volatility index (VIX), and the price of the cryptocurrencies to determine if there is a predictive behavior. We will analyze data of three top cryptocurrencies traded based on market popularity; these are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The time frame of our analysis will be two years from July of 2019 through June of 2021. We will source this data from Alpaca, Quandl, and Coinbase using APIs.

### Project Objective:

We find the cryptocurrency market fascinating and want to analyze how the cyryptocurrency market correlates with the stock market and it's volatility. We could use this information to aid in determining trends that would be useful in designing an investement portfolio.

### Research Questions:

Do price movements of Bitcoin correspond with movements in the stock market and volatility index? If so, do movements in the price of Bitcoin  pre-date, align, or post-date movements in the the stock market and volatility index?

Do price movements of Ethereum correspond with movements in the stock market and volatility index? If so, do movements in the price of Ethereum  pre-date, align, or post-date movements in the stock market and volatility index?

Do price movements of Litecoin correspond with movements in the stock market and volatility index? If so, do movements in the price of Litecoin  pre-date, align, or post-date movements in the stock market and volatility index?

Based on the analysis of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, do movements in the price of the various cryptocurrencies in the market and the respective movements in the stock market and volatility index correlate with each other?

### Datasets to be Used:

Bitcoin price data from 2019-07-01 to 2021-07-01 using the Coinbase API.

Ethereum price data from 2019-07-01 to 2021-07-01 using the Coinbase API.

Litecoin price data from 2019-07-01 to 2021-07-01 using the Coinbase API.

SPY SSgA Active Trust - S&P 500 ETF TRUST ETF data from 2019-07-01 to 2021-07-01 using the Alpaca API.

VIX Volatility Index data from 2019-07-01 to 2021-07-01 using the Quandl API.
